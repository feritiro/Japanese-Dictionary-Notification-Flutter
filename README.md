A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project was a test to see if Flutter allowed custom notifications on the lockscreen.
- It didn't. It does not allowed to show bigger font sizes in the notification or mpre customizations such as buttons.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
